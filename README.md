## About

> These are the rules of a game. Let it be played upon an infinite two-dimensional grid of flowers.
>
> Rule One. A living flower with less than two living neighbors is cut off. It dies.
>
> Rule Two. A living flower with two or three living neighbors is connected. It lives.
>
> Rule Three. A living flower with more than three living neighbors is starved and overcrowded. It dies.
>
> Rule Four. A dead flower with exactly three living neighbors is reborn. It springs back to life.
>
> The only play permitted in the game is the arrangement of the initial flowers.
